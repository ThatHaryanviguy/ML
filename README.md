# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects (with a focus on Bioinformatics)

Welcome to my machine learning repository! This space showcases my journey through machine learning and deep learning, with a strong emphasis on applications in biology and bioinformatics.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository will contain a collection of hands-on ML projects, including but not limited to:

- 🧬 Gene expression analysis
- 🔬 Dimensionality reduction & clustering in bio datasets
- 🧪 Disease classification from biological signals
- 📊 Traditional ML algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- 🤖 Deep learning projects (Autoencoders, CNNs, RNNs, etc.)

Each project will be documented in its own folder and include:
- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
- Data source or link (if public)
- Visualizations & model outputs
- README with problem statement, methodology, and results

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

I primarily use:

- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn
- Keras / TensorFlow
- pandas & NumPy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter notebooks
